# ASP.NET Core MVC with AdminLTE Integration

This project is a demonstration of how to integrate the popular **AdminLTE v3.2.0** dashboard template into an **ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC** application. It includes a fully styled user authentication system using ASP.NET Core Identity.

This implementation is based on the detailed tutorial by [codewithmukesh](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/integrating-adminlte-with-aspnet-core/), updated to work with the latest .NET standards.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
*   [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the "ASP.NET and web development" workload installed.
*   A SQL Server instance (SQL Server Express or the LocalDB version included with Visual Studio is sufficient).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/u89447758/AdminLTE.MVC.git
    cd AdminLTE.MVC
    ```

2.  **Open the solution**
    *   Open the `AdminLTE.MVC.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3.  **Update the database connection string**
    *   Open the `appsettings.json` file.
    *   Ensure the `DefaultConnection` string points to your SQL Server instance. The default configuration for SQL LocalDB should work out-of-the-box with Visual Studio.

4.  **Apply Entity Framework Migrations**
    *   This will create the database and all the necessary tables for user authentication.
    *   In Visual Studio, go to **Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console**.
    *   Run the following command:
        ```powershell
        Update-Database
        ```

5.  **Run the application**
    *   Press `F5` or click the green play button in Visual Studio to build and run the project.
    *   Your browser should open to the home page, displaying the full dashboard.
